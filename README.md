# apalache-tests

This repository contains various benchmarks for evaluating performance of the
[Apalache model checker](https://github.com/konnov/apalache). Many of these
benchmarks are adapted from the [TLA+
examples](https://github.com/tlaplus/Examples) and thus are distributed under
[their license](https://github.com/tlaplus/Examples/blob/master/LICENSE.md).
Some benchmarks have their own licenses, which we kindly ask you to respect.

**These specifications should not be used for learning TLA+**.
We are collecting the specifications that are challenging for our model checker.
These specifications are usually modified in a way that makes it easier
Apalache to analyze them. So these specifications may contain bugs that were not present in the original specifications.

**If you like to learn TLA+**, check [Leslie Lamport's TLA+ Home Page](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html).

(***********************************************************************)
(* Specification of an allocator managing a set of resources:          *)
(* - Clients can request sets of resources whenever all their previous *)
(*   requests have been satisfied.                                     *)
(* - Requests can be partly fulfilled, and resources can be returned   *)
(*   even before the full request has been satisfied. However, clients *)
(*   only have an obligation to return resources after they have       *)
(*   obtained all resources they requested.                            *)
(* This allocator operates by repeatedly choosing a schedule according *)
(* to which requests are satisfied. Resources can be allocated out of  *)
(* order as long as no client earlier in the schedule asks for them.   *)

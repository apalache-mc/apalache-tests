\* Global variables

\* A bag of records representing requests and responses sent from one server
\* to another. TLAPS doesn't support the Bags module, so this is a function
\* mapping Message to Nat.
VARIABLE
    \* @type: [ mtype: Str, mterm: Int, mlastLogTerm: Int, mlastLogIndex: Int, msource: Str, mdest: Str, mvoteGranted: Bool, mlog: Seq([term: Int, value: Str]), mprevLogIndex: Int, mprevLogTerm: Int, mentries: Seq([term: Int, value: Str]), mcommitIndex: Int, msuccess: Bool, mmatchIndex: Int ] -> Int ;
    messages


\* A history variable used in the proof. This would not be present in an
\* implementation.
\* Keeps track of successful elections, including the initial logs of the
\* leader and voters' logs. Set of functions containing various things about
\* successful elections (see BecomeLeader).

VARIABLE
    \* @type: Set([eterm: Int, eleader: Str, elog: Seq([eterm: Int, value: Str]), evotes: Set(Str), evoterLog: Str -> Seq([term: Int, value: Str])]);
    elections

\* A history variable used in the proof. This would not be present in an
\* implementation.
\* Keeps track of every log ever in the system (set of logs).

VARIABLE
    \* @type: Set(Seq([eterm: Int, value: Str]));
    allLogs
----
\* The following variables are all per server (functions with domain Server).
\* The server's term number.
VARIABLE
    \* @type: Str -> Int;
    currentTerm

\* The server's state (Follower, Candidate, or Leader).
VARIABLE
    \* @type: Str -> Str;
    state

\* The candidate the server voted for in its current term, or
\* Nil if it hasn't voted for any.
VARIABLE
    \* @type: Str -> Str;
    votedFor
serverVars == <<currentTerm, state, votedFor>>

\* A Sequence of log entries. The index into this sequence is the index of the
\* log entry. Unfortunately, the Sequence module defines Head(s) as the entry
\* with index 1, so be careful not to use that!
VARIABLE
    \* @type: Str -> Seq([eterm: Int, value: Str]);
    log
\* The index of the latest entry in the log the state machine may apply.
VARIABLE
    \* @type: Str -> Int;
    commitIndex
logVars == <<log, commitIndex>>

\* The following variables are used only on candidates:
\* The set of servers from which the candidate has received a RequestVote
\* response in its currentTerm.
VARIABLE
    \* @type: Str -> Set(Str);
    votesResponded
\* The set of servers from which the candidate has received a vote in its
\* currentTerm.
VARIABLE
    \* @type: Str -> Set(Str);
    votesGranted
\* A history variable used in the proof. This would not be present in an
\* implementation.
\* Function from each server that voted for this candidate in its currentTerm
\* to that voter's log.
VARIABLE
    \* @type: Str -> (Str -> Seq([term: Int, value: Str]));
    voterLog
candidateVars == <<votesResponded, votesGranted, voterLog>>

\* The following variables are used only on leaders:
\* The next entry to send to each follower.
VARIABLE
    \* @type: Str -> (Str -> Int);
    nextIndex
\* The latest entry that each follower has acknowledged is the same as the
\* leader's. This is used to calculate commitIndex on the leader.
VARIABLE
    \* @type: Str -> (Str -> Int);
    matchIndex
leaderVars == <<nextIndex, matchIndex, elections>>

\* End of per server variables.
----

\* All variables; used for stuttering (asserting state hasn't changed).

\* Helpers

\* The set of all quorums. This just calculates simple majorities, but the only
\* important property is that every quorum overlaps with every other.
\*Quorum == {i \in SUBSET(Server) : Cardinality(i) * 2 > Cardinality(Server)}
\* igor: see the constant above

\* The term of the last entry in a log, or 0 if the log is empty.

LastTerm(xlog) == IF Len(xlog) = 0 THEN 0 ELSE xlog[Len(xlog)].term

\* Safety properties that can be found in Appendix B of Ongaro's thesis

Lemma2 == \A e, f \in elections: e.eterm = f.eterm => e.eleader = f.eleader

Lemma4 ==
  \A l, m \in allLogs:
    \A index \in DOMAIN l:
      index \in DOMAIN m /\ m[index].term = l[index].term
        => \A pindex \in {i \in DOMAIN l: i <= index}:
          l[pindex] = m[pindex]
          
\* obviously, this property should be violated at some point
NoLeaders == \A s \in Server: state[s] /= Leader

OneLeader == \A s, t \in Server: s = t \/ state[s] /= Leader \/ state[t] /= Leader          

\* obviously, this property should be violated at some point          
NoCommits == \A s \in Server: commitIndex[s] = 0
          
\* obviously, this property should be violated at some point          
TwoLogs ==
  \A l, m \in allLogs: l = m

\* APALACHE: to use finite sets, we need bounds on the maximum index and term
MaxIndex == 4
MaxTerm == 4

===============================================================================

\* Changelog:
\*
\* 2014-12-02:
\* - Fix AppendEntries to only send one entry at a time, as originally
\*   intended. Since SubSeq is inclusive, the upper bound of the range should
\*   have been nextIndex, not nextIndex + 1. Thanks to Igor Kovalenko for
\*   reporting the issue.
\* - Change matchIndex' to matchIndex (without the apostrophe) in
\*   AdvanceCommitIndex. This apostrophe was not intentional and perhaps
\*   confusing, though it makes no practical difference (matchIndex' equals
\*   matchIndex). Thanks to Hugues Evrard for reporting the issue.

(* other processes one at a time--in the while loop at label w1.  The      *)
(* Moses-Patkin algorithm performs those examinations in parallel.         *)
(* Because PlusCal does not allow sub-processes, it would be difficult     *)
(* (but not impossible) to express that algorithm in PlusCal.  It would be *)
(* easy to express their version in TLA+ (for example, by modifying the    *)

(*                                                                         *)
(* I started with a PlusCal encoding and invariance proof of the Bakery    *)
(* Algorithm.  The only non-obvious part of that encoding is how it        *)
(* represented the safe registers assumed by the algorithm, which are      *)
(* registers in which reads and writes are not atomic.  A safe register is *)
(* represented by a variable r whose value is written by performing some   *)
(* number of atomic writes of non-deterministically chosen "legal" values  *)
(* to r followed by a single write of the desired value.  A read of the    *)
(* register is performed by a single atomic read of r.  It can be shown    *)
(* that this captures the semantics of a safe register.                    *)
(*                                                                         *)
(* Starting from the PlusCal version of the Bakery Algorithm, it was easy  *)
(* to modify it to the Boulangerie Algorithm (with the simplification      *)
(* described above).  I model checked the algorithm on some small models   *)
(* to convince myself that there were no trivial errors that would be      *)
(* likely to arise from an error in the encoding.  I then modified the     *)
(* invariant by a combination of a bit of thinking and a fair amount of    *)
(* trial and error, finding errors in the invariant by model checking very *)
(* small models.  (I checked it on two processes with chosen numbers       *)
(* restricted to be at most 3.)                                            *)

(* When checking on a small model revealed no error in the invariant, I    *)
(* checked the proof with TLAPS (the TLA+ proof system).  The high level   *)
(* proof, consisting of steps <1>1 - <1>4, are standard and are the same   *)
(* as for the Bakery Algorithm.  TLAPS checks this simple four-step proof  *)
(* for the Bakery Algorithm with terminal BY proofs that just tell it to   *)
(* use the necessary assumptions and to expand all definitions.  This      *)
(* didn't work for the hard part of the Boulangerie Algorithm--step <1>2   *)
(* that checks inductive invariance.                                       *)
(*                                                                         *)
(* When a proof doesn't go through, one keeps decomposing the proof of the *)
(* steps that aren't proved until one sees what the problem is.  This      *)
(* decomposition is done with little thinking and no typing using the      *)
(* Toolbox's Decompose Proof command.  (The Toolbox is the IDE for the     *)
(* TLA+ tools.) Step <1>2 has the form A /\ B => C, where B is a           *)
(* disjunction, and the Decompose Proof command produces a level-<2> proof *)
(* consisting of subgoals essentially of the form A /\ Bi => C for the     *)
(* disjuncts Bi of B.  Two of those subgoals weren't proved.  I decomposed *)
(* them both for several levels until I saw that in one of them, some step *)
(* wasn't preserving the part of the invariant that asserts                *)
(* type-correctness.  I then quickly found the culprit: a silly error in   *)
(* the type invariant in which I had in one place written the set Proc of  *)
(* process numbers instead of the set Nat of natural numbers.  After       *)
(* correcting that error, only one of the level-<2> subgoals remained      *)
(* unproved: step <2>5.  Using the Decompose Proof command as far as I     *)
(* could on that step, one substep remained unproved.  (I think it was at  *)
(* level <5>.) Looking at what the proof obligations were, the obvious     *)
(* decomposition was a two-way case split, which I did by manually         *)
(* entering another level of subproof.  One of those cases weren't proved, *)
(* so I tried another two-way case split on it.  That worked.  I then made *)
(* that substep to the first step of the (level <3>) proof of <2>5, moving *)
(* its proof with it.  With that additional fact, TLAPS was able to prove  *)
(* <2>5 in one more step (the QED step).                                   *)
(*                                                                         *)
(* The entire proof now is about 70 lines.  I only typed 20 of those 70    *)
(* lines.  The rest either came from the original Bakery Algorithm         *)
(* (8-line) proof or were generated by the Decompose Proof Command.        *)
(*                                                                         *)
(* I don't know how much time I actually spent writing the algorithm and   *)
(* its proof.  Except for the final compaction of the (correct) proof of   *)
(* <2>5, the entire exercise took me two days.  However, most of that was  *)
(* spent tracking down bugs in the Toolbox.  We are in the process of      *)
(* moving the Toolbox to a new version of Eclipse, and there are many bugs *)
(* that must be fixed before it's ready to be released.  I would estimate  *)
(* that it would have taken me less than 4 hours without Toolbox bugs.  I  *)
(* find it remarkable how little thinking the whole thing took.            *)
(*                                                                         *)
